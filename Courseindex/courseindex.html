    The course index assignment was kind of confusing at first. I did not really undertsand what the main objective of this assignment was however, after asking a couple of questions and rereading the assignment page I understood what I needed to do. Though, I was still scared about coding an entire website by myself and what it would turn out to look like. Despite my worry, I started by just creating the html file and slowly adding things to it. The class lectures and tutorials were very helpful too and I used each and everyone while designing my site. In addition the different submissions made it easier for me as I did not have to think of it as a whole from the start instead, we had like steps or levels we needed to complete every couple of days.

 <p class="firstpage"> 
     First, we were asked to start with the first page of our websites. We had to merely create an HTML file that includes front page matter and upload it publicly on the web. This task was not tough to complete it was rather easy especially since we were shown how to do it in class.

 <p class="styleandstructure"> Then, we worked with the style and structure of the webite and the page we created. We had to use an external style sheet that is properly linked to our HTML file where we would work on the positioning, fonts, and forms of the website. Then, we were again asked to publish it on the web. </p>

<p class="homepage">   
     Next, we were to start putting together our homepage. This was quite tough as I was unsure of the way I wanted my design to look and also because it was tough learning how to design using code. I was not used to working with code to design websites, in the past I always used a design platform to help create a website, so having to code the entire thing sounded tough. Nonetheless, the homepage had to link to multiple pages such as the assignments page where we would post our course work as well as the process of our assignments. Linking the pages was actually easier than I had expected it to be.

<p class="examplemajorassignmentpage">
    The final step we had to complete before the final submission was creating either one or more pages that include the process of our assignments. The task was not tough as by now I had grasped the coding aspect of the assignment however, it was quite time consuming as I decided to create a separate process page for each assignment.

<p class="end"> Overall, this assignment was very helpful for two reasons, the first being that it allows us to implement the skills we learned in class over the course of the entire semester in one assignment and the second being the fact that it provides us with a solid portfolio to present to others where our hard work and process is displayed in a neat manner. </p>

        The aim for this assignment was to design a 24"x36" poster using anything but digital design platforms such as adobe. The poster had to depic one of two things; how you see the future of design or your life under Covid-19. I chose the prompt relating to Covid-19 as I felt like I would be able to express myself better than if I used the other prompt. To realise this poster, I decided to use my macbook desktop to show the events that took place in my during Covid-19. I used screenshots of my pictures and the activities I took part in during that time and assembled them in my desktop. I split my poster into four categories; online learning, communication, reminicing, and passing time.

    <p id="aim">
        For this assignment, each student was assigned one letter from a phrase for them to make a daily sketch of for 21 days using coding and more specifically Javascript and p5. We were to implement the news techniques we were learning in class simultaneously as well as explore generative art. We were given the freedom of sketching our letters however we like the only requirement was for the canvas to be 1000px by 1000px. At the end of the assignment we were to choose the one we liked most from out collection and plug it back into the phrase to reassemble it.

        <p id="aim"> This assignment requires us to look into our own embodied interactions with the digital tools and environments such as applications and platforms that we utilize on a daily basis. We are asked to engage in auto-ethnographic research by observing as well sa documenting our interactions and experiences with these digital tools. Using the results from the research, we are asked to create and design an infrographic that visualizes our interaction through both qualitative and quantitative methods. Based on these instructions, I chose to observe and record qualitative and quantitative information of my interactions with the Facetime App on my Iphone

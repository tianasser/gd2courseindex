 <p class="aim"> In class, we came up with a phrase that has the exact number of characters as the number of students in class and each on of us was assigned a letter to work with. The aim of this assignment was to using coding in the language JavaScript and create a daily sketch of the letter we were assigned to enhance our coding skills as well as to incorporate animations using jquery into our code. Over the course of three weeks, we were to create a sketch a day leaving us with 21 sketches in which we explored generative art and incorporated elements of coding we learned in class. </p>
 <p class="mywork"> Here are the 21 sketches I did over the course of three weeks. I tried my best to incorporate aspects of coding we learned in class.</p>

<P class="aboutme-main"> <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> As a Graphic Designer living in Toronto, I aim to to have balance between my educational life and social life. Although most times it is tough, I created a very detailed schedule that includes the hours of the day dedicated to studying and those dedicated to going out with friends or even just sitting at home and resting. Graphic Design 2 is my core class this semester and therefore requires the most hours of studying per week. Core classes are worth one whole credit and require constant work throughout the semester inorder to succeed.

<p>In this course we will have around four assignments; Cofounding Tools, Parametrics and Generations, Me of the Screen, and Course Index. Each tackles a specific aspect of the course and helps us further achieve the goal of properly knowing how to code and familiarizing ourselves with the tools and platforms that help us do so. </p>
    <div class="speechbubble-1"></div>
    <div class="speechbubble-after"></div>
    <p><u>The first assignment;</u> Cofounding Tools, requires us to create a poster that portrays one of two things; our lives during Covid-19 or how we see the future of design without using softwares made for designing. This means that we cannot use any adobe platforms. Instead we should try to find ways to use other platforms such as phone games, social media apps, and others to create a piece of art depicting one of the topics.</p>
    <p><u>The second assignment;</u> Parametrics and Generation, we will be assigned one character that we would have to create a daily sketch of using coding for three weeks. This will help us better practice our skills and broaden our horizons on coding and graphic design.</p>
    <p><u>The third assignment;</u> The Me of the Screen, includes self-observation and documentation as design-based research and then combining our finidng s with two, three, or four dimensional spaces to create a dynamic piece.</p>
    <p><u>The fourth assignment;</u> Course Index, is a semester-long assignment that rewuires us to work on it throught the entire time of the course. The goal is to create a webiste that documents all our process, work, reflections, and finidngs throught the semester and this course. This will be done through the use of coding; HTML, CSS, and Javascript.</p> </p>

<p class="heading"><strong> <u>MODULES</u> </strong></p>
<p class="box-text"> Modules are basically tasks that need to be completed by specific dates; usually before the first class of the week. Modules include readings, watching lectures, practicing our skills in the feilds we are learning about, and engaging in class discussions to get a better understanding of a subject and read other peoples opionions. </p>
</div>

<div class="box-2"> 
<p class="heading"><strong> <u><a href="Assignments/assignments.html">ASSIGNMENTS</a></u> </strong></p>
<p class="box-text"> Assignments are the main projects that we complete throught the duration of the course. Assignments can be anything from creating a website, to creating a poster, or making models. Assignments usually take around three weeks to be completed and require a lot of time and effort. Our assignments usually reflect what we leared throught the course and the skills we develop from the activities we do in the modules on weekly basis. </p>

<div class="box-3">
<p class="heading"><strong> <u><a href="Readings/readings.html">READINGS& DISCUSSIONS</a></u> </strong></p>
<p class="box-text"> The readings in this course educate us on topics we discuss in class and then ask us to write written responses on questions related to the readings. This allows us to engage with one another as we would be able to read the different responses and have to comment on a couple of our peer's answers.
</div>

<div class="courseindex">
    <p class="heading"><strong> <u><a href="Courseindex/courseindex.html">COURSE INDEX</a></u> </strong></p>
    <p class="courseindextext">
        The course index assignment, is a semester long project that we work on from start to end. The objective is to create a platform; in this case a website, where we can publish all of our assignments, readings, discussions, and modules that we completed throughout the entirety of the course. We are only provided with a list of deliverables and the content our websites should include and the rest is up to us to add and design. The website was to be entirely hand-coded by ourselves and available online. In other words, the course index assignment is a sort of portfolio building task that requires us to incorporate the coding techniques we learned during the course.
